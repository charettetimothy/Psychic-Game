# Psychic-Game
Oh Javascript how I love thee. This is my very first Javascript game creating experience. Frustrating and fun all in one short period of time. Interacting with the DOM, funnctions, variables, if statements, arrays and much more, its all here. What a confusing, difficult and humbling beginning to my coding journey. Enjoy and be nice, it was my first time after all.
